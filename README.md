# Breast Cancer Detection Using Various Classification Algorithms
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to accurately detect the presence of breast cancer in patients using various classification algorithms. The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains 569 instances of breast cancer samples, with 30 features describing each sample.
# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps performed in this project include:

Importing the dataset using pandas.
Checking for missing values and outliers.
Encoding the categorical target variable to numerical values.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Scaling the feature values using standardization.
# Model Training
The following classification algorithms were used to train the model:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
The models were trained using the training set and evaluated using the testing set. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results
The performance of the different models is summarized below:

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in accurately detecting breast cancer in patients. The logistic regression model achieved the highest accuracy among the models evaluated, indicating its potential as a reliable diagnostic tool.
